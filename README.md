# DSA Masterbook
This repository is basically made up of my own data structure implementations while learning Data Structures & Algorithms using Python.

Use this to track :
1. Problem solutions of interesting/tough dsa problems
2. My own data structure implementations
3. Interesting algorithms
4. Any courses followed for DSA
5. Useful resources/cheatsheets

Rules for tracking :
1. Add timestamp for the commit in title (DD/MM/YY)
2. Brief phrase for title
3. Detailed description (if required) in commit message.
